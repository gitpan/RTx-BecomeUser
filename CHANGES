1.2_1 2011-11-15
    Changed to work with RT4. Navigation menu system is changed from 3.x and bugs fixed where
    after changing top a user, any other action would leave you logged out at a login screen.
    
1.10_2	
	Add impersonation sub-tab to user page.

	Changed BecomeUser argument from UserName to User since it accepts ids.

1.10_1	2009-08-06
	Should now work in 3.8, en lieu of redirecting to front page,
	which seemed to cause 3.8 problems, BecomeUser displays a note.

	Separate lists for priveleged and unpriveleged users.
